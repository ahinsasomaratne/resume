        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a 23-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in 
            Information Technology at the University of Moratuwa. With a passion 
            for technology and an insatiable curiosity, I thrive on learning new 
            skills and concepts that enhance my understanding of the IT landscape. 
            My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in software 
            development, networking, and systems management.</p>
        <p>As an enthusiastic learner, I am particularly drawn to the field of 
            information security. My goal is to become an Information Security Analyst, 
            where I can apply my knowledge to protect organizations from evolving cyber
            threats. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development,
            actively seeking opportunities to expand my expertise in cybersecurity 
            practices and tools. With a strong determination and a proactive approach, 
            I aim to contribute to a secure digital environment for businesses and 
            individuals alike.</p>
